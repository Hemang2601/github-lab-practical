## Description
This practical demonstrates repository creation, branching, pull requests,
issue management, and collaboration using GitHub.

## Taxi Service Management – Team Collaboration (GitHub)

This Taxi Service Management project was developed using only the GitHub web interface. The team created multiple branches to work on different modules such as booking, driver management, and documentation. This allowed parallel development without affecting the main branch.

To manage teamwork and avoid confusion, pull requests were used to review and merge changes safely. GitHub’s conflict detection helped identify and resolve overlapping changes between branches. When documentation became unclear, an issue was raised and resolved by updating the README file.

For beginners, the most important GitHub features are branches, pull requests, and issues. Pull requests are especially important because they allow safe merging, review of changes, and conflict prevention without using command-line tools.
